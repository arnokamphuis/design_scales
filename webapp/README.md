## Features

### üéØ **Core Functionality**
- Calculate scaling factors for terrain images on A0, A1, A2, and A3 paper sizes
- Automatic orientation optimization (chooses portrait vs. landscape for maximum feasible scale)
- Support for 15 standard map scales (1:100 to 1:500,000, now including 1:150)
- Customizable print DPI (72-1200 DPI)
- Maximum coverage control (1-100%)
- Real-time calculation and validation

### üé® **Modern Interface**
- Clean, responsive design that works on all devices
- Interactive form with real-time validation
- Professional results tables with clear indicators
- Example usage generation
- Smooth animations and transitions

### üìä **Detailed Results**
- Scaling factors for each paper size and map scale combination
- Final image dimensions in pixels
- Actual scale achieved (when target scale isn't possible)
- Paper coverage percentages (after orientation selection)
- Orientation shown in each paper section header (e.g. "A3 Paper (landscape)")
- Clear indication of exact vs. approximate scales

### ‚ö° **User Experience**
- No installation required - runs in any modern web browser
- Instant calculations with client-side processing
- Form validation with helpful error messages
- Responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile use

## How to Use

### 1. **Input Image Parameters**
- **Image Width/Height**: Enter the dimensions of your original terrain image in pixels
- **Reference Pixels**: Number of pixels in your image that represent a known distance
- **Reference Distance**: The real-world distance (in meters) that those pixels represent

### 2. **Configure Print Settings**
- **Print DPI**: Target resolution for printing (default: 300 DPI)
- **Max Coverage**: Maximum percentage of paper to use (default: 100%)
- **Paper Size Filter**: Optionally show results for specific paper size only
- **Scale Filter**: Optionally show results for specific map scale only

### 3. **Calculate and Review Results**
- Click "Calculate Scaling Factors" to generate results
- Review the results table showing scaling factors, final dimensions, and coverage
- Check the example usage section for practical application instructions
- Look for ‚úì (exact scale achieved) or ‚úó (approximate scale due to paper constraints)

## Understanding the Results

### Results Table Columns
- **Target Scale**: The desired map scale (e.g., 1:2000)
- **Scaling Factor**: Multiplication factor to apply when printing
- **Final Size (px)**: Resulting image dimensions after scaling
- **Actual Scale**: The map scale actually achieved (may differ from target)
- **Coverage %**: Percentage of the selected orientation's usable paper used (width √ó height)
- **Exact Scale?**: Whether the exact target scale was achieved

### Color Coding
- **Green ‚úì**: Target scale achieved exactly
- **Orange ‚úó**: Target scale not achievable, maximum possible scaling used

## Technical Details

### Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers with ES6+ support
- Chrome 60+, Firefox 55+, Safari 12+, Edge 79+
- Responsive design works on mobile devices

### Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Semantic markup with modern form elements
- **CSS3**: Grid/Flexbox layouts, custom properties, animations
- **JavaScript ES6+**: Classes, arrow functions, destructuring
- **Font Awesome**: Icons for better visual hierarchy
- **Google Fonts**: Inter font family for professional typography

### Performance
- Client-side calculations (no server required)
- Lightweight (~50KB total including assets)
- Responsive design optimized for all screen sizes

## Installation

### Option 1: Direct Usage
1. Download or clone the repository
2. Open `webapp/index.html` in any modern web browser
3. Start using the calculator immediately

### Option 2: Local Web Server (Recommended)
```bash
# Using Python 3
cd webapp
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js
cd webapp
npx serve .

# Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

### Option 3: Deploy to Web Server
1. Upload the entire `webapp` folder to your web server
2. Access via your domain/webapp URL
3. No server-side processing required

## Example Usage

### Scenario: Printing a 2769√ó3253 pixel terrain image
- **Reference**: 2498 pixels = 114.21 meters in the real world
- **Goal**: Print at 1:2000 scale on A3 paper
- **Orientation Chosen**: Landscape (automatically selected to maximize scaling)

**Result**: Apply scaling factor 0.2700 to achieve exact 1:2000 scale with 21.3% √ó 17.7% paper coverage.
